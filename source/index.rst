Welcome to Infantium's SDK documentation!
=========================================

Infantium's SDK is specially focused to adapt mobile applications to work and communicate with Infantium servers. It's
purpose is to provide an intuitive and easy to use interface to communicate your App with Infantium's cognitive analysis
platform.

The SDK is programmed in native Android/Java, but is also deployed in other frameworks through a ever increasing set
of different plugins. Check the `Plugins`_ page to check if your framework has already been adapted! Otherwise, don't
get discouraged! Contact us and we will be more than happy to give you assistance to create a new plugin in any
framework you might use.

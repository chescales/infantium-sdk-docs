=========

Knowing the `Elements`_ on the screen is crucial for our analysis, but all of it would lack a real value if we didn't
know what are the micro-objectives in the current activity the kid is playing, and of course the final goal. Knowing
**what the kid has to do** is as important as knowing **what the kid actually does**. Knowing what the kid has to do
is what Goals are for.

Elements
===============

Elements are the main reference objects in the data sent to the server by the SDK. They can represent persons,
 animals, objects, numbers, images, text, or any other thing the kid can interact with, either actively or passively.
 Knowing what the kid can see on the screen at the moment of performing any action is crucial to reach conclusions
 about recurring patterns in the kids actions, just to name an example.
